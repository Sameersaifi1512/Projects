# Semantic Segmentation Models for WBCs Segmentation

This repository provides an overview of the project conducted between January 2023 and June 2023, focusing on the evaluation of popular segmentation models for white blood cell (WBC) nuclei extraction. Please note that due to a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with respective authorities, the code and project deliverables cannot be shared in this repository.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate popular segmentation models, including U-Net, SegNet, Attention U-Net, and Swin-Unet, for accurate extraction of white blood cell nuclei. The evaluation was performed on the RAABIN-WBC dataset.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Keras
- TensorFlow


## Key Findings

Based on the conducted study, the model with the lowest loss and highest Dice score on the RAABIN-WBC dataset was identified. However, further details regarding the specific model and its performance metrics cannot be shared due to the NDA.
