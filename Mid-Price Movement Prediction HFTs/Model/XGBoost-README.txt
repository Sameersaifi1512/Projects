This README.txt provides information about the model files for the XGBoost algorithm used in predicting future mid-price movements of stocks. The trained model files are included in the 'Model' folder for reference.

xgboost_model.bin: The trained XGBoost model file.
xgboost_model_params.txt: This file contains the best-tuned parameters used for training the XGBoost model.
xgboost_model_description.txt: A high-level overview of the XGBoost model, including its architecture and key features.
Instructions for Reusing the XGBoost Model:

Load the xgboost_model.bin file to initialize the trained XGBoost model.
Refer to the xgboost_model_params.txt file to set the parameters accordingly when using the XGBoost model for predictions.
Review the xgboost_model_description.txt file for a comprehensive understanding of the XGBoost model's architecture and features.
By following these instructions, any third person can successfully reuse the XGBoost model for predicting mid-price movements of stocks.
