This README.txt provides information about the model files for the CATBoost algorithm used in predicting future mid-price movements of stocks. The trained model files are included in the 'Model' folder for reference.

catboost_model.bin: The trained CATBoost model file.
catboost_model_params.txt: This file contains the best-tuned parameters used for training the CATBoost model.
catboost_model_description.txt: A high-level overview of the CATBoost model, including its architecture and key features.
Instructions for Reusing the CATBoost Model:

Load the catboost_model.bin file to initialize the trained CATBoost model.
Refer to the catboost_model_params.txt file to set the parameters accordingly when using the CATBoost model for predictions.
Review the catboost_model_description.txt file for a comprehensive understanding of the CATBoost model's architecture and features.
By following these instructions, any third person can successfully reuse the CATBoost model for predicting mid-price movements of stocks.
